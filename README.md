# war-card-game
An implementation in R of the card game War and some variants

This project began with an observation that the simple card game War is not actually wholly deterministic, because there is no rule or convention governing the order in which won cards are added to the bottom of the winner's hand. I imagined how this observation could be made game-theoretically interesting, and posited a version of the game with only two players, in which the winner of a hand wins the cards, but the loser chooses the order in which the winner must place them on the bottom of their hand. Since in that case, the game becomes a game of perfect information after no more than 26 hands, I model it as a game of perfect information from the outset. The mode of play therefore evolves such that the loser of a hand has agency to sculpt matchups many, many hands in advance, anticipating optimal play by the other player. At maximum depth, we evaluate the status of the game as sum(value of cards in p1's hand) - sum(value of cards in p2's hand).
